# VCC with React and Hooks

Created a little UI to interact with the code.

- The processing page has two main states: error & success
- A 1 second delay can be added to the process. It's a callback to an asynchronous function which waits for the promise to resolve after a setTimeout function is called.
- The states are managed by the useState hook.
- Callbacks are trigged by the useEffect hook.
- Components are reusable and the project is scalable with little to no effort.
